=========

Below you can find download links to the tagged Shampoo versions
for Emacs and for the various Smalltalk implementations.

Shampoo packages for Emacs, GNU Smalltalk and Pharo are being released
simultaneously, so ensure that you use the frontend (Emacs mode)
and the backend (image-side server) of the same versions. Shampoo is
under heavy development, the communication protocol changes from
version to version and the backward compatibility is not guaranted.

If you want to get the latest development sources, refer to the page
[Contribution][].

All the releases are available under terms of the MIT license.
